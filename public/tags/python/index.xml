      <description>The problem to solve Every month there is a task to update exchange rates in a markdown file. All there is to do is to send an API request to get the foreign exchange rates and currency conversion, extract the data from the response, and then format it.
A perfect job for Python! The only challenge is that we do not want to include API key in the Python script. How to handle that?</description>

Whether a side project or a hobby, it feels like we are all spending time learning new things outside of working hours&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get familiar with Python. One day it dawned on me that maybe I can use my new knowledge with Goodreads.
Get the data First, export the information of books from Goodreads.
Log in to Goodreads, go to My Books &amp;gt; Tools, and select Import and Export.</description>
