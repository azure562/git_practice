While jogging early in the morning, I noticed an ambulance passing by. It caught my attention because it was quiet. When trying to follow it, it disappeared. Then I realized it was running behind some bushes.

So, I talked to myself: look, you only see the gap when there is an interruption.

Then, I came to a joint. So, wait, an interruption is not necessarily bad. It could also be an open opportunity. Now it's your chance to decide your direction.
