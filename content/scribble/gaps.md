While jogging early in the morning, I noticed an ambulance car passing. It attracted my attention because it's quiet. When trying to follow it, it disappeared. Then I realized it was behind some bush.

So, I talked to myself: look, you only see the gap when there is an interuption.

Then, I came to a joint. So, wait, an interuption is not necessarily bad. It could also be an open opportunity. Now it's your chance to choose your direction.
